# Coffee-Dataset-EDA

<font size=5>**Data Description**</font>

This project uses the datasets from `Coffee Dataset` available in Kaggle: `https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/michals22/coffee-dataset`. All the data was originally from the official International Coffee Organization (ICO) website: `https://www.ico.org/new_historical.asp`, and was bought into a usable form by **MICHA≈Å SIKORA** using jupyter notebook (which is available on the Kaggle website provided above).

<font size=5>**Objective of this Project**</font>

In this project we will run a simple EDA on the coffee imports and exports data from 1990 to 2020 from countries all around the world. The idea of this project is to understand the data using **Exploratory Data Analysis** with the help of **Python and/or SQL** while also using **Tableau Public** to create a dashboard and showcase our findings.
